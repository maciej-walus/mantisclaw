Simple Python OSINT application. Currently implemented features:

- Providing some basic information about a phone number

Plans, hopes and dreams:

- GUI
- IP address checker
- Username finder

And maybe even more with time, we'll see. For now, my primary focus is on cleaning and improving the code of current features.
